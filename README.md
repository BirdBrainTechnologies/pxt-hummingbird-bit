# pxt-hummingbird-bit

## Block Reference
These blocks control the Hummingbird Bit, a microcontroller board that extends the micro:bit to enable you to create 

Start Hummingbird: This block is required for every Hummingbird program
Hummingbird LED: Sets a single color LED on port 1, 2, or 3 to a brightness value from 0% to 100%.
Hummingbird Tr-LED: Sets a tri-color LED on port 1 or 2 to the color specified by red, green, and blue brightness values. The values range from 0% to 100%.
Hummingbird Position Servo: Sets a position servo on port 1, 2, 3, or 4 to an angle from 0° to 180°.
Hummingbird Rotation Servo: Sets a rotation servo on port 1, 2, 3, or 4 to a rotation speed from -100% to 100%.
Hummingbird Light: Reads the value of the sensor on port 1, 2, or 3. Readings for the distance sensor are given in cm. All other readings range from 0 to 100 (no units).
Hummingbird Battery: Reads the value of the battery in milliVolts. You may start to see strange behavior when the value is below 4630 mV.

## TODO

- [ ] Add a reference for your blocks here
- [ ] Add "icon.png" image (300x200) in the root folder
- [ ] Add "- beta" to the GitHub project description if you are still iterating it.
- [ ] Turn on your automated build on https://travis-ci.org
- [ ] Use "pxt bump" to create a tagged release on GitHub
- [ ] Get your package reviewed and approved https://makecode.microbit.org/packages/approval
